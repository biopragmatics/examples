def: "BRAF mutations are found to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of these\, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid \(V600E\) is the most prevalent. V600E has been determined to be an activating mutation\, and cells that harbor it\, along with other V600 mutations are sensitive to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. It is also common to use MEK inhibition as a substitute for BRAF inhibitors\, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib has seen some success in BRAF mutant melanomas. BRAF mutations have also been correlated with poor prognosis in many cancer types\, although there is at least one study that questions this conclusion in papillary thyroid cancer. Oncogenic BRAF mutations are divided into three categories that determine their sensitivity to inhibitors. Class 1 BRAF mutations \(V600\) are RAS-independent\, signal as monomers and are sensitive to current RAF monomer inhibitors. Class 2 BRAF mutations \(K601E\, K601N\, K601T\, L597Q\, L597V\, G469A\, G469V\, G469R\, G464V\, G464E\, and fusions\) are RAS-independent\, signaling as constitutive dimers and are resistant to vemurafenib. Such mutants may be sensitive to novel RAF dimer inhibitors or MEK inhibitors. Class 3 BRAF mutations \(D287H\, V459L\, G466V\, G466E\, G466A\, S467L\, G469E\, N581S\, N581I\, D594N\, D594G\, D594A\, D594H\, F595L\, G596D\, and G596R\) with low or absent kinase activity are RAS-dependent and they activate ERK by increasing their binding to activated RAS and wild-type CRAF. Class 3 BRAF mutations coexist with mutations in RAS or NF1 in melanoma may be treated with MEK inhibitors. In epithelial tumors such as CRC or NSCLC may be effectively treated with combinations that include inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase." []

def: "TP53 mutations are universal across cancer types. The loss of a tumor suppressor is most often through large deleterious events\, such as frameshift mutations\, or premature stop codons. In TP53 however\, many of the observed mutations in cancer are found to be single nucleotide missense variants. These variants are broadly distributed throughout the gene\, but with the majority localizing in the DNA binding domain. There is no single hotspot in the DNA binding domain\, but a majority of mutations occur in amino acid positions 175\, 245\, 248\, 273\, and 282 \(NM_000546\) \(Olivier et al.\, 2010\). To fulfill its proper biological function four TP53 polypeptides must form a tetramer which functions as a transcription factor\, therefore even if one out of four polypeptides has inactivating mutation it may lead to dominant negative phenotype of variable degree. While a large proportion of cancer genomics research is focused on somatic variants\, TP53 is also of note in the germline. Germline TP53 mutations are the hallmark of Li-Fraumeni syndrome\, and many \(both germline and somatic\) variants have been found to have a prognostic impact on patient outcomes. The significance of many polymorphisms for susceptibility and prognosis of disease is still very much up for debate." []

NOTCH proteins are characterized by N-terminal EGF-like repeats followed by LNR domains which form a complex with ligands to prevent signaling. The Notch signaling pathway is involved in processes related to cell fate specification\, differentiation\, proliferation\, and survival. Activation of Notch has been shown to be correlative with mammary tumorgenesis in mice and increased expression of Notch receptors has been observed in a variety of cancer types including cervical\, colon\, head and neck\, lung\, renal\, pancreatic\, leukemia\, and breast cancer. A number of treatment modalities have been explored related to Notch inhibition especially in breast cancer with mixed results." []

def: "Von Hippel-Lindau \(VHL\) disease is characterized by heterozygous germline mutation in VHL gene on chromosome 3p. Patients are predisposed to developing hemangioblastomas of the brain\, spinal cord\, and retina; renal cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma; pheochromocytoma\, pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors; endolymphatic sac tumors; and epididymal and broad ligament cysts. Cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be associated with headache\, vomiting\, gait disturbances\, or ataxia. Spinal hemangioblastomas and related syrinx usually present with pain. Sensory and motor loss may develop with cord compression. Retinal hemangioblastomas may be the initial manifestation of VHL disease and can cause vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma occurs in about 70% of individuals with VHL and is the leading cause of mortality. Pheochromocytomas can be asymptomatic but may cause sustained or episodic hypertension. Pancreatic lesions often remain asymptomatic and rarely cause endocrine or exocrine insufficiency. Endolymphatic sac tumors can cause hearing loss of varying severity\, which can be a presenting symptom. Cystadenomas of the epididymis are relatively common. They rarely cause problems\, unless bilateral\, in which case they may result in infertility. The VHL gene product encodes pVHL\, which binds to elongin C\, elongin B\, cullin-2 and Rbx1. This complex catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of specific proteins and targets them for degradation by proteosomes. For example\, under normoxic conditions\, hydroxylated hypoxia-inducble factor alpha subunits \(HIFÎ±\) binds pVHL targets HIFÎ± for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions\, HIF1Î± is not hydroxylated\, pVHL does not bind\, and HIF1Î± subunits accumulate. HIF1Î± forms heterodimers with HIF1Î² and activates transcription of a variety of hypoxia-inducible genes \(i.e.\, VEGF\, EPO\, TGFÎ±\, PDGFÎ²\). Likewise\, when pVHL is absent or mutated\, HIF1Î± subunits accumulate\, resulting in cell proliferation and the neovascularization of tumors characteristic of VHL disease. Pathogenic variants in VHL either prevent its expression \(i.e.\, deletions\, frameshifts\, nonsense mutations\, and splice site mutations\) or lead to the expression of an abnormal protein \(i.e.\, missense mutations\). Missense mutations that destabilize packing of the alpha-helical domains\, decrease the stability of the alpha-beta domain interface\, interfere with binding of elongin C and HIF1Î±\, or disrupt hydrophobic core residues result in loss of HIF regulation and are more likely to result in VHL type 1 \(no predisposition to pheochromocytoma\). Missense mutations that result in pVHL that is normal with respect to HIF regulation are more likely to be associated with VHL with clinical pheochromocytoma. Acquired somatic pathogenic variants in VHL may give rise to sporadic VHL-type tumors \(i.e.\, clear cell RCC and hemangioblastoma\) without other associated tumors characteristic of the hereditary disease. It should be noted that >90% of the most common form of kidney cancer \(clear cell renal cell carcinoma\) are associated with bi-allelic somatic mutation in the VHL gene\, and is the rationale for the anti-angiogenic therapy for RCC patients."

def: "Ataxia-telangiectasia \(A-T\) is a recessive disorder resulting from germline mutation of the A-T mutated \(ATM\) gene on chromosome 11q. Upon sensing double-stranded breaks \(DSB\)\, the wild-type kinase encoded by ATM initiates the DNA-damage response by phosphorylating histone H2AX and\, subsequently\, various other proteins\, such as BRCA1 and the MRE11â€“RAD50â€“NBS1 \(MRN\) complex\, which are recruited to the damaged site. Additionally\, ATM phosphorylates p53\, resulting in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and leading to senescence or apoptosis. Somatic variants can result in inhibition or loss of these functions and can cause resistance to therapies that rely on inducing apoptosis via DSBs. Germline variants in A-T patients result in a predisposition to cancer\, most frequently hematologic or breast.

def: "FGF3 is a member of the basic fibroblast growth factor \(FGF\) gene family and was first identified based on it's similarity to the mouse proto-oncogene int-2. Amplifications of this gene and the surrounding region \(11q13\) have been observed in various cancers including breast cancer\, esophogeal cancer\, melanoma\, bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma \(HCC\). Lower tumor grade and stage have been associated with FGF3 amplifications in HCC; however\, this event is fairly rare in this tumor type." []

def: "FGFR1 is a member of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family\, comprising of 4 receptors and 18 Ligands. FGFR1 signalling downstream functions mainly via PI3K and MAPK pathways \(Turner et. al.\). Several ways of involvement of FGFR1 in cancer have been proposed\: auto- and paracrine activation\, amplification and overexpression \(Marshall et. al\, Weiss et. al.\, Cheng et. al.\). Especially amplification of FGFR1 in lung cancer is an emerging treatment target with clinical studies currently ongoing \(e.g. NCT01004224\). However\, FGFR1 amplification does not always correlate with protein expression and predictive biomarkers still remain to be defined in clinic \(von MÃ¤ssenhausen et. al.\). Mutation of FGFR1 seems to be less common\, but has been described in glioblastoma\, pilocytic astrocytomas and Ewing's sarcoma \(Rand et. al.\, Jones et. al.\, Agelopoulos et. al.\)." []

def: "ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently involved in genetic rearrangement in a variety of human cancers \(e.g. NSCLC\, gastric cancer\, ovarian cancer\, cholangiocarcinoma\, colorectal cancer\, angiosarcoma...\). The resulting fusion protein harbors the constitutively active ROS1 kinase domain and drives cellular proliferation \(Davies et. al.\). In NSCLC about 1% harbor a ROS1 rearrangement. These patients are predominantely female and have a lower T-stage \(Warth et. al.\). Treatment with crizotinib leads to a reported objective response rate of appr. 70% and a median duration of response of 18 months \(Shaw et. al.\). Resistance mechanisms to crizotinib have been described and involve mutations in the kinase domain. More selective inhibitors of ROS1 might overcome this resistance \(Davare et. al.\)." []

PD1 expression has been observed in a variety of cancers including melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. The interaction of PD1/PDL1 is hypothesized to be a possible mechanism for the tumor to escape immune response. A number of checkpoint blockade inhibitors including pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been developed that target the PD1/PDL1 interaction in order to allow T-cells to recognize tumor cells without being deactivated by the tumor."

def: "BIRC7 encodes the protein Livin which is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein \(IAP\) family. Livin consists of a single baculoviral IAP repeat domain \(BIR\) and a RING domian at the C-terminus. The protein inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting proteolytic activation of capsases. Overexpression of Livin has been observed in a variety of cancers including lung\, colon\, and prostate compared to most normal adult tissues and has been proposed as a putative therapeutic target."
