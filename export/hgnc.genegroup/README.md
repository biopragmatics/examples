# HGNC Gene Group

The HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee) provides an approved gene name and symbol (short-form abbreviation) for each known human gene. All approved symbols are stored in the HGNC database, and each symbol is unique. In addition, HGNC also provides a unique numerical ID to identify gene families, providing a display of curated hierarchical relationships between families.
