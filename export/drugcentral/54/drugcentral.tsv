1	nitric oxide	A free radical gas produced endogenously by a variety of mammalian cells, synthesized from ARGININE by NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE. Nitric oxide is one of the ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT RELAXING FACTORS released by the vascular endothelium and mediates VASODILATION. It also inhibits platelet aggregation, induces disaggregation of aggregated platelets, and inhibits platelet adhesion to the vascular endothelium. Nitric oxide activates cytosolic GUANYLATE CYCLASE and thus elevates intracellular levels of CYCLIC GMP. It has been shown to have in vitro activity against severe acute res-piratory syndrome corona-virus (SARS-CoV-1) but evidence supporting the use of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 patients is currently limited.

1059	lenalidomide	Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory, antiangiogenic, and antineoplastic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumor cells including multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and del (5q) myelodysplastic syndromes in vitro. Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models including multiple myeloma. Immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide include activation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, increased numbers of NKT cells, and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha and IL-6) by monocytes. In multiple myeloma cells, the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone synergizes the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis.	depoestradiol|depoestradiol cypionate|estradiol cyclopentylpropionate|estradiol cypionate

1087	benznidazole	Benznidazole inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins within the T. cruzi parasite. Studies suggest that benznidazole is reduced by a Type I nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme of T. cruzi producing a series of short-lived intermediates that may promote damage to several macromolecules including DNA. In mammalian cells, however, benznidazole is metabolized by reduction of the nitro group to an amino group by a Type II NTR enzyme. The precise mechanism of action is not known. Benznidazole is active against all three stages, trypomastigotes, amastigotes, and epimastigotes, of T. cruzi. However, the sensitivity of T. cruzi strains to benznidazole, from different geographic regions, may vary.	3-Methyl-3-ethylsuccinimide|ethosuxide|ethosuximide|etosuximid

1110	gemcitabine	Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1/S-phase boundary. Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis, resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations, including dCTP. Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA (selfpotentiation). After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands, which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death.	3-Oxodesogestrel|etonogestrel|implanon

1281	azathioprine	Azathioprine is an inactive pro-drug of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake and intracellular anabolism to thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) for  immunosuppression. TGNs and other metabolites (e.g. 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides) inhibit de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. The TGNs are also incorporated into nucleic acids and this contributes to the immunosuppressive effects of the medicinal product. Other potential mechanisms of azathioprine include the inhibition of many pathways in nucleic acid biosynthesis, hence preventing proliferation and activity of cells involved in the immune response (B and T lymphocytes). Because of these mechanisms, the therapeutic effect of azathioprine may be evident only after several weeks or months of treatment. Unlike 6-MP, the activity of the azathioprine metabolite 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-thioimidazole has not been clearly determined. However, compared with 6-MP it appears to modify the activity of azathioprine in several systems. According to the Fourth Annual Report on Carcinogens (NTP 85-002, 1985), this substance has been listed as a known carcinogen.

1283	entecavir	Entecavir, a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV reverse transcriptase, is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, which has an intracellular half-life of 15 hours. By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate, entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV reverse transcriptase: (1) base priming, (2) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA, and (3) synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA. Entecavir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and delta and mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma with Ki values ranging from 18 to > 160 microM.	gamcitabine|gemcitabine|gemcitabine HCl|gemcitabine hydrochloride

It is also a metabolite of two other veterinary drugs: netobimin and albendazole. The mechanism of action of ricobendazole (albendazole sulfoxide), ensuring its anthelmintic activity, is associated with selective inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization. It binds to the colchicine site of tubulin, inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It also exhibits anticancer activity, potentiating the effects of taxanes and inhibiting cell proliferation in breast cancer cells, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and melanoma cells. Also, albendazole oxide has been shown to induce apoptosis in human cancer cell line HT-29, possibly by arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase.

1689	clofarabine	Clofarabine is sequentially metabolized intracellularly to the 5’-monophosphate metabolite by deoxycytidine kinase and mono- and di-phospho-kinases to the active 5’-triphosphate metabolite. Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase, equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate, deoxycytidine. Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5’-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death. Clofarabine is cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and quiescent cancer cell types in vitro.	mepenzolate|mepenzolate bromide|mepenzolon

1711	entacapone	Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of COMT. COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure. Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites. The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites. When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	mercaptoethanesulfonic acid|mesna|reduced coenzyme M

By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT-1), nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the catabolic intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these catabolic intermediates are converted to the toxic metabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate, which are responsible for the observed liver and kidney toxicity.	4-Aminosalicylic acid|4-Carboxy-3-hydroxyaniline|aminosalicylate potassium|aminosalicylate sodium|aminosalicylic acid|aminosalicylic acid resin complex|apacil|calcium aminosalicylate|p-aminosalicylic acid|para-aminosalicylic acid|potassium aminosalicylate|sodium aminosalicylate|teebacin

207	ethadione					
2070	icosapent ethyl	Icosapent ethyl is a stable ethyl ester of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The mechanisms of action contributing to reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl are not  completely understood. The mechanisms are likely multi-factorial including improved lipoprotein profile with reduction of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, reduction of macrophage accumulation, improved endothelial function, increased fibrous cap thickness/stability, and antiplatelet effects. Each of these mechanisms   can beneficially alter the development, progression, and stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaque, as well as the implications of plaque rupture, and preclinical and clinical studies support such benefits with EPA. Systemic and localised anti-inflammatory effects of EPA may result from displacement of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid (AA), directing catabolism away from eicosanoids (2-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 4-series leukotrienes) to non- or anti-inflammatory mediators. However, the direct clinical meaning of individual findings is not clear.	pazufloxacin|pazufloxacin mesilate|pazufloxacin mesylate

2454	metolazone	Metolazone is a quinazoline diuretic, with properties generally similar to the thiazide diuretics. The actions of metolazone result from interference with the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. Metolazone acts primarily to inhibit sodium reabsorption at the cortical diluting site and to a lesser extent in the proximal convoluted tubule. Sodium and chloride ions are excreted in approximately equivalent amounts. The increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubular exchange site results in increased potassium excretion. Metolazone does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase. A proximal action of metolazone has been shown in humans by increased excretion of phosphate and magnesium ions and by a markedly increased fractional excretion of sodium in patients with severely compromised glomerular filtration. This action has been demonstrated in animals by micropuncture studies.	6,8-Carvomenthenediol|DL-trans-sobrelol|ciclidrol|cutepin|cyclidrol|pinol hydrate|pinolhydrat|sobrepin|sobrerol

278	levetiracetam	The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown. The antiepileptic activity of levetiracetam was assessed in a number of animal models of epileptic seizures. Levetiracetam did not inhibit single seizures induced by maximal stimulation with electrical current or different chemoconvulsants and showed only minimal activity in submaximal stimulation and in threshold tests. Protection was observed, however, against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures induced by pilocarpine and kainic acid, two chemoconvulsants that induce seizures that mimic some features of human complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. Levetiracetam also displayed inhibitory properties in the kindling model in rats, another model of human complex partial seizures, both during kindling development and in the fully kindled state. In vitro and in vivo recordings of epileptiform activity from the hippocampus have shown that levetiracetam inhibits burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting that levetiracetam may selectively prevent hypersynchronization of epileptiform burst firing and propagation of seizure activity. Levetiracetam at concentrations of up to 10 uM did not demonstrate binding affinity for a variety of known receptors, such as those associated with benzodiazepines, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), glycine, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), re-uptake sites, and second messenger systems. Furthermore, in vitro studies have failed to find an effect of levetiracetam on neuronal voltage-gated sodium or T-type calcium currents and levetiracetam does not appear to directly facilitate GABAergic neurotransmission. However, in vitro studies have demonstrated that levetiracetam opposes the activity of negative modulators of GABA- and glycine-gated currents and partially inhibits N-type calcium currents in neuronal cells. A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.	azosemid|azosemide|diurapid			
2780	roflumilast	Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme in lung tissue) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP.

284	gabapentin	The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its analgesic action is unknown, but in animal models of analgesia, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to painful stimuli). In particular, gabapentin prevents pain-related responses in several models of neuropathic pain in rats or mice (e.g., spinal nerve ligation models, streptozocin-induced diabetes model, spinal cord injury model, acute herpes zoster infection model). Gabapentin also decreases pain-related responses after peripheral inflammation (carrageenan footpad test, late phase of formalin test). Gabapentin did not alter immediate pain-related behaviors (rat tail flick test, formalin footpad acute phase, acetic acid abdominal constriction test, footpad heat irradiation test). The mechanism by which gabapentin exerts its anticonvulsant action is unknown, but in animal test systems designed to detect anticonvulsant activity, gabapentin prevents seizures as do other marketed anticonvulsants. Gabapentin exhibits antiseizure activity in mice and rats in both the maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazole seizure models and other preclinical models (e.g., strains with genetic epilepsy, etc.). Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) but it does not modify GABAA or GABAB radioligand binding, it is not converted metabolically into GABA or a GABA agonist, and it is not an inhibitor of GABA uptake or degradation. Gabapentin was tested in radioligand binding assays at concentrations up to 100 uM and did not exhibit affinity for a number of other common receptor sites, including benzodiazepine, glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), quisqualate, kainate, strychnine-insensitive or strychnine-sensitive glycine, alpha 1, alpha 2, or beta adrenergic, adenosine A1 or A2, cholinergic muscarinic or nicotinic, dopamine D1 or D2, histamine H1, serotonin S1 or S2, opiate mu, delta or kappa, cannabinoid 1, voltage-sensitive calcium channel sites labeled with nitrendipine or diltiazem, or at voltage-sensitive sodium channel sites labeled with batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate. Furthermore, gabapentin did not alter the cellular uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline, or serotonin. In vitro studies with radiolabeled gabapentin have revealed a gabapentin binding site in areas of rat brain including neocortex and hippocampus. A high-affinity binding protein in animal brain tissue has been identified as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels.	balsalazide|balsalazide disodium|balsalazide sodium

285	rasagiline	Rasagiline is a selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor indicated for the treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The results of a clinical trial designed to examine the effects of rasagiline tablets on blood pressure when it is administered with increasing doses of tyramine indicates the functional selectivity can be incomplete when healthy subjects ingest large amounts of tyramine while receiving recommended doses of rasagiline tablets. The selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B diminishes in a dose-related manner. One mechanism is believed to be related to its MAO-B inhibitory activity, which causes an increase in extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum. The elevated dopamine level and subsequent increased dopaminergic activity are likely to mediate rasagiline’s beneficial effects seen in models of dopaminergic motor dysfunction.

2881	salmeterol	Salmeterol is a selective long acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta2-adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor-induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. It has received approval to be used in combination with fluticasone.

3368	tenofovir disoproxil	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is the fumarate salt of the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir disoproxil is absorbed and converted to the active substance tenofovir, which is a nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue. Tenofovir is then converted to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate, an obligate chain terminator, by constitutively expressed cellular enzymes. Tenofovir diphosphate has an intracellular half-life of 10 hours in activated and 50 hours in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and the HBV polymerase by direct binding competition with the natural deoxyribonucleotide substrate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma. At concentrations of up to 300 umol/l, tenofovir has also shown no effect on the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA or the production of lactic acid in in vitro assays.	leucodiniene|myricodine|myrocodine|myrophin|myrophine|myrophinium

3424	aliskiren	Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non-ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g., ACE or non-ACE pathways, is not known.	cis-(+/-)-Pentazocine|dl-Pentazocine|pentazocin|pentazocine|pentazocine HCl|pentazocine hydrochloride|pentazocine lactate

3821	pramlintide	Pramlintide is an analog of human amylin. Amylin is colocated with insulin in secretory granules and cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells in response to food intake. Amylin and insulin show similar fasting and postprandial patterns in healthy individuals. In patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there is reduced secretion from pancreatic beta cells of both insulin and amylin in response to food. Amylin affects the rate of postprandial glucose appearance through a variety of mechanisms, as determined by nonclinical studies. Amylin slows gastric emptying (i.e., the rate at which food is released from the stomach to the small intestine) without altering the overall absorption of nutrients. In addition, amylin suppresses glucagon secretion (not normalized by insulin alone), which leads to suppression of endogenous glucose output from the liver. Amylin also regulates food intake due to centrally-mediated modulation of appetite. In human studies, pramlintide, acting as an amylin analog, slows gastric emptying, reduces the postprandial rise in plasma glucagon, and modulates satiety leading to decreased caloric intake.

3879	temsirolimus	Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6 ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway was blocked. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor.				
388	enflurane	An extremely stable inhalation anesthetic that allows rapid adjustments of anesthesia depth with little change in pulse or respiratory rate.	AD-5423|blonanserin|lonasen			
3880	dexlansoprazole	Dexlansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, dexlansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production.	benidipine|benidipine HCl|benidipine hydrochloride|coniel

It binds the human progesterone receptor and prevents progesterone from occupying its receptor. The likely primary mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception is inhibition or delay of ovulation.	bucricaine|bucricaine HCl|bucricaine hydrochloride			
3885	fingolimod	A sphingosine-derivative and IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENT that blocks the migration and homing of LYMPHOCYTES to the CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM through its action on SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE RECEPTORS. It is used in the treatment of MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.				
3886	lurasidone	The mechanism of action of lurasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression is unclear. However, its efficacy in schizophrenia and bipolar depression could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine D2 and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism.				
3887	ceftaroline fosamil	Ceftaroline is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug with in vitro activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The bactericidal action of ceftaroline is mediated through binding to essential penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftaroline is bactericidal against S. aureus due to its affinity for PBP2a and against Streptococcus pneumoniae due to its affinity for PBP2x.

3888	tesamorelin	Growth Hormone-Releasing Factor (GRF), also known as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), is a hypothalamic peptide that acts on the pituitary somatotroph cells to stimulate the synthesis and pulsatile release of endogenous growth hormone (GH), which is both anabolic and lipolytic. GH exerts its effects by interacting with specific receptors on a variety of target cells, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes, hepatocytes, and adipocytes, resulting in a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some, but not all these effects, are primarily mediated by IGF-1 produced in the liver and in peripheral tissues. In vitro, tesamorelin binds and stimulates human GRF receptors with similar potency as the endogenous GRF.				
3889	eribulin	Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of mitotic spindles, and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage. In addition, eribulin treatment of human breast cancer cells caused changes in morphology and gene expression as well as decreased migration and invasiveness in vitro. In mouse xenograft models of human breast cancer, eribulin treatment was associated with increased vascular perfusion and permeability in the tumor cores, resulting in reduced tumor hypoxia, and changes in the expression of genes in tumor specimens associated with a change in phenotype.				
3890	boceprevir	Boceprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease that is necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B proteins. Boceprevir covalently, yet reversibly, binds to the NS3 protease active site serine (S139) through an (alpha)-ketoamide functional group to inhibit viral replication in HCV-infected host cells. In a biochemical assay, boceprevir inhibited the activity of recombinant HCV genotype 1a and 1b NS3/4A protease enzymes, with Ki values of 14 nM for each subtype.				
3891	telaprevir	Telaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A serine protease, necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B proteins and essential for viral replication. In a biochemical assay, telaprevir inhibited the proteolytic activity of the recombinant HCV NS3 protease domain with an IC50 value of 10 nM.	Panipenem-betamipron mixt|carbenin			
3892	rilpivirine	A diarylpyrimidine derivative and REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE INHIBITOR with antiviral activity against HIV-1 that is used in the treatment of HIV INFECTIONS. It is also used in combination with other ANTI-HIV AGENTS, since ANTIVIRAL DRUG RESISTANCE emerges rapidly when it is used alone.	SCMC-Lys|carbocysteine lysine|carbocysteine-lysine			
3893	linagliptin	Linagliptin is an inhibitor of DPP-4, an enzyme that degrades the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Thus, linagliptin increases the concentrations of active incretin hormones, stimulating the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner and decreasing the levels of glucagon in the circulation. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. Incretin hormones are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1 also reduces glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output.				
3894	abiraterone acetate	Abiraterone acetate is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis. CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17alpha-hydroxy derivatives by 17alpha-hydroxylase activity and 2) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17,20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. Abiraterone acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of abiraterone acetate on serum testosterone levels.				
3895	gabapentin enacarbil	Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin and, accordingly, its therapeutic effects in restless legs syndrome and postherpetic neuralgia are attributable to gabapentin. In animal models of analgesia, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to painful stimuli).				
3896	vandetanib	In vitro studies have shown that vandetanib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGFR and VEGFR families, RET, BRK, TIE2, and members of the EPH receptor and Src kinase families. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the N-desmethyl metabolite of the drug, representing 7 to 17.1% of vandetanib exposure, has similar inhibitory activity to the parent compound for VEGF receptors (KDR and Flt-1) and EGFR. In vitro, vandetanib inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in tumor cells and endothelial cells and VEGF-stimulated tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in endothelial cells. In vivo, vandetanib administration reduced tumor cell-induced angiogenesis, tumor vessel permeability, and inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models of cancer.

Following administration of DaTscan to humans, radioactive decay of the iodine 123 emits gamma radiation which can be detected externally using gamma detectors, allowing visualization of the brain striata through SPECT imaging. Autoradiography of post-mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane shows concentration of the radiolabel in striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). The specificity of the binding of ioflupane I 125 to dopamine transporter was demonstrated by competition studies with the DaT inhibitor GBR 12909 (a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), the serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, and the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor desipramine in post-mortem human brain slices exposed to radiolabeled ioflupane.  Citalopram reduced binding in the neocortex and thalamus with only minor effects in the striatum. This indicated that the binding in the cortex and thalamus is mainly to the serotonin reuptake sites.  Desipramine showed no effect on the level of striatal binding of ioflupane I 125, but reduced extrastriatal binding by 60 to 85%.  The binding of ioflupane I 125 to the striatum was abolished in the presence of high concentrations of GBR 12909, indicating selectivity of ioflupane binding for the pre-synaptic DaT.

4091	vernakalant	Vernakalant is an antiarrhythmic medicine that acts preferentially in the atria to prolong atrial refractoriness and to rate-dependently slow impulse conduction. These anti-fibrillatory actions on refractoriness and conduction are thought to suppress re-entry, and are potentiated in the atria during atrial fibrillation. The relative selectivity of vernakalant on atrial versus ventricular refractoriness is postulated to result from the block of currents that are expressed in the atria, but not in the ventricles, as well as the unique electrophysiologic condition of the fibrillating atria. However, blockade of cationic currents, including hERG channels and cardiac voltage-dependent sodium channels, which are present in the ventricles has been documented.				
4092	voclosporin	Voclosporin is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant. The mechanism of voclosporin suppression of calcineurin has not been fully established. Activation of lymphocytes involves an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations that bind to the calcineurin regulatory site and activate calmodulin binding catalytic subunit and through dephosphorylation activates the transcription factor, Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cell Cytoplasmic (NFATc). The immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell cytokine production, and expression of T-cell activation surface antigens.

4139	plerixafor	Plerixafor is an inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha).  SDF-1alpha and CXCR4 are recognized to play a role in the trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the marrow compartment. Once in the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can act to help anchor these cells to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1α or through the induction of other adhesion molecules. Treatment with plerixafor resulted in leukocytosis and elevations in circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice, dogs and humans.

4201	esketamine	Esketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine. It is a non-selective, non-competitive, antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. Through NMDA receptor antagonism, esketamine produces a transient increase in glutamate release leading to increases in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) stimulation and subsequently to increases in neurotrophic signalling which may contribute to the restoration of synaptic function in these brain regions involved with the regulation of mood and emotional behaviour. Restoration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in brain regions involved in the reward and motivation, and decreased stimulation of brain regions involved in anhedonia, may contribute to the rapid response.	calcium chloride

Fluticasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

4322	iobenguane (131I)	AZEDRA is an I 131 labeled iobenguane. Iobenguane is similar in structure to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and is subject to the same uptake and accumulation pathways as NE. Iobenguane is taken up by the NE transporter in adrenergic nerve terminals and accumulates in adrenergically innervated tissues, such as the heart, lungs, adrenal medulla, salivary glands, liver, and spleen as well as tumors of neural crest origin. Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumors of neural crest origin that express high levels of the NE transporter on their cell surfaces. Following intravenous administration, AZEDRA is taken up and accumulates within pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cells, and radiation resulting from radioactive decay of I 131 causes cell death and tumor necrosis.

4367	linaclotide	Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist. Both linaclotide and its active metabolite bind to GC-C and act locally on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C results in an increase in both intracellular and extracellular concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Elevation in intracellular cGMP stimulates secretion of chloride and bicarbonate into the intestinal lumen, mainly through activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) ion channel, resulting in increased intestinal fluid and accelerated transit. In animal models, linaclotide has been shown to both accelerate GI transit and reduce intestinal pain. The linaclotide-induced reduction in visceral pain in animals is thought to be mediated by increased extracellular cGMP, which was shown to decrease the activity of pain-sensing nerves.

4558	vilanterol	Vilanterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist. The clinical relevance of this in vitro finding is unknown. Although beta2-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects. The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenergic agonist drugs, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

4619	cridanimod	A small molecule that can increase progesterone receptor (PR) expression, with potential antineoplastic adjuvant activity. Upon intramuscular administration, cridanimod is able to induce the expression of PR in endometrial cancer. This could increase the sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to progestin monotherapy. In combination with a progestin, cancer cells could be eradicated through increased PR-mediated signaling, leading to an inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, via a negative feedback mechanism, and, eventually, an inhibition of estrogen release from the ovaries. This leads to an inhibition of cellular growth in estrogen-dependent tumor cells. In addition, this agent is able to increase the production and release of interferon (IFN) alpha and beta. PR is often downregulated in endometrial cancer and makes it resistant to progestin-mediated hormone therapy.	(-)-alpha-Bisabolol|bisabolol|kamillosan|levomenol

4714	palbociclib	Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are downstream of signaling pathways which lead to cellular proliferation. In vitro, palbociclib reduced cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by blocking progression of the cell from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth arrest compared to treatment with each drug alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence compared to each drug alone, which was sustained for up to 6 days following palbociclib removal and was greater if antiestrogen treatment was continued. In vivo studies using a patient-derived ER-positive breast cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth compared to each drug alone.	bivalos|distrontium renelate|osseor|protelos|strontium ranelate

4748	infliximab	Infliximab products neutralize the biological activity of TNF-alpha by binding with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-alpha and inhibit binding of TNF-alpha with its receptors. Infliximab products do not neutralize TNF-beta (lymphotoxin-alpha), a related cytokine that utilizes the same receptors as TNF-alpha. Biological activities attributed to TNF-alpha include: induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, enhancement of leukocyte migration by increasing endothelial layer permeability and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and eosinophil functional activity, induction of acute phase reactants and other liver proteins, as well as tissue degrading enzymes produced by synoviocytes and/or chondrocytes. Cells expressing transmembrane TNF-alpha bound by infliximab products can be lysed in vitro or in vivo. Infliximab products inhibit the functional activity of TNF-alpha in a wide variety of in vitro bioassays utilizing human fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils, B and T-lymphocytes and epithelial cells. The relationship of these biological response markers to the mechanism(s) by which infliximab products exert their clinical effects is unknown. Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies reduce disease activity in the cotton-top tamarin colitis model, and decrease synovitis and joint erosions in a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis. Infliximab products prevent disease in transgenic mice that develop polyarthritis as a result of constitutive expression of human TNF-alpha, and when administered after disease onset, allow eroded joints to heal.	phencarol|quifenadine|quifenadine HCl|quifenadine hydrochloride

4993	baricitinib	Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2. Janus kinases (JAKs) are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a number of cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune function. Within the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. Baricitinib modulates these signalling pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. FDA issued an Emergency use authorization (EUA) on November 19, 2020 that permits use of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized patients ≥2 years of age requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

Increased rucaparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair genes. Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA.	elitek|fasturtec|rasburicase			
4995	ferumoxytol	Ferumoxytol consists of a superparamagnetic iron oxide that is coated with a carbohydrate shell, which helps to isolate the bioactive iron from plasma components until the iron-carbohydrate complex enters the reticuloendothelial system macrophages of the liver, spleen and bone marrow. The iron is released from the iron-carbohydrate complex within vesicles in the macrophages. Iron then either enters the intracellular storage iron pool (e.g., ferritin) or is transferred to plasma transferrin for transport to erythroid precursor cells for incorporation into hemoglobin.	epoetin alfa|epoetin alfa (genetical recombination)|epoetin alfa-epbx|epogen|erythropoietin|procrit			
4996	interferon alfa-2b	Interferon alfa-2b is an alpha interferon and is a water-soluble protein with a molecular weight of 19,271 daltons produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Interferons exert their cellular activities by binding to specific membrane receptors on the cell surface. Once bound to the cell membrane, interferons initiate a complex sequence of intracellular events. In vitro studies demonstrated that these include the induction of certain enzymes, suppression of cell proliferation, immunomodulating activities such as enhancement of the phagocytic activity of macrophages and augmentation of the specific cytotoxicity of lymphocytes for target cells, and inhibition of virus replication in virus-infected cells. Interferon alfa via inhalation is included in national guidelines from China as a possible option for treatment of COVID-19.	AMG-531|AMG531|nplate|romiplostim

5009	ribociclib	Ribociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6. These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins and play a crucial role in signaling pathways which lead to cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. The cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex regulates cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). In vitro, ribociclib decreased pRb phosphorylation leading to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduced cell proliferation in breast cancer cell lines. In vivo, treatment with single agent ribociclib in a rat xenograft model with human tumor cells led to decreased tumor volumes, which correlated with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation. In studies using patient-derived estrogen receptor positive breast cancer xenograft models, combination of ribociclib and antiestrogen (e.g. letrozole) resulted in increased tumor growth inhibition compared to each drug alone.

5012	avelumab	Avelumab is a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody. Avelumab is a human IgG1 lambda monoclonal antibody that has a molecular weight of approximately 147 kDa. PD-L1 may be expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells and can contribute to the inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors found on T cells and antigen presenting cells suppresses cytotoxic T-cell activity, T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1. This interaction releases the inhibitory effects of PD-L1 on the immune response resulting in the restoration of immune responses, including anti-tumor immune responses. Avelumab has also been shown to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro.	AHU377|sacubitril|sucabitril			
5013	niraparib	Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was observed in tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and in human patient-derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency that had either mutated or wild type BRCA1/2.

5027	brigatinib	Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity at clinically achievable concentrations against multiple kinases including ALK, ROS1, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), and FLT-3 as well as EGFR deletion and point mutations. Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, and S6 in in vitro and in vivo assays. Brigatinib also inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. At clinically achievable concentrations (<= 500 nM), brigatinib inhibited the in vitro viability of cells expressing EML4-ALK and 17 mutant forms associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors including crizotinib, as well as EGFR-Del (E746-A750), ROS1-L2026M, FLT3-F691L, and FLT3-D835Y. Brigatinib exhibited in vivo anti-tumor activity against 4 mutant forms of EML4-ALK, including G1202R and L1196M mutants identified in NSCLC tumors in patients who have progressed on crizotinib. Brigatinib also reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival in mice implanted intracranially with an ALK-driven tumor cell line.	SCH 619734|SCH619734|rolapitant|rolapitant hydrochloride|varubi			
5028	durvalumab	Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80 (B7.1). Blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses, without inducing antibody dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). PD-L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T-cell activation in vitro and decreased tumor size in co-engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models.

5031	sarilumab	Sarilumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 subclass. Sarilumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension culture. Sarilumab binds to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis. Based on encouraging results in China with a similar drug, tocilizumab, a phase 2/3 US study evaluating efficacy and safety of sarilumab in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 was performed. At the moment, there are insufficient data to recommend either for or against use of sarilumab for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

5043	inotuzumab ozogamicin	Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a CD22-directed monoclonal antibody that is covalently linked to N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. Inotuzumab is a humanised immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody that specifically recognises human CD22. The small molecule, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic product. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via an acid-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of Inotuzumab ozogamicin is due to the binding of the ADC to CD22-expressing tumour cells, followed by internalisation of the ADC-CD22 complex, and the intracellular release of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. Activation of N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide induces double-stranded DNA breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.	sacrosidase|sucraid|sucrase

5056	abemaciclib	Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.

5057	acalabrutinib	Acalabrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK. Acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity. BTK is a signaling molecule of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, an  adhesion. In nonclinical studies, acalabrutinib inhibited BTK mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69 and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation and survival.

5059	letermovir	Letermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase complex (pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89) which is required for viral DNA processing and packaging. Biochemical characterization and electron microscopy demonstrated that letermovir affects the production of proper unit length genomes and interferes with virion maturation. Genotypic characterization of virus resistant to letermovir confirmed that letermovir targets the terminase complex.	S 888711|S-888711|lusutrombopag|mulpleta			
506	ethotoin	Ethotoin exerts an antiepileptic effect without causing general central nervous system depression. The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges.	carbuterol|carbuterol HCl|carbuterol hydrochloride			
5060	benralizumab	Benralizumab is a humanized afucosylated, monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa) that directly binds to the alpha subunit of the human interleukin-5 receptor (IL-5Ralpha) with a dissociation constant of 11 pM. The IL-5 receptor is expressed on the surface of eosinophils and basophils. In an in vitro setting, the absence of fucose in the Fc domain of benralizumab facilitates binding (45.5 nM) to FcɣRIII receptors on immune effectors cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, leading to apoptosis of eosinophils and basophils through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in inflammation. Benralizumab, by binding to the IL-5Ralpha chain, reduces eosinophils through ADCC; however, the mechanism of benralizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established.

5064	semaglutide	Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1. GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that has multiple actions on glucose, mediated by the GLP-1 receptors. The principal mechanism of protraction resulting in the long half-life of semaglutide is albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance and protection from metabolic degradation. Furthermore, semaglutide is stabilized against degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme. Semaglutide reduces blood glucose through a mechanism where it stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion, both in a glucose-dependent manner. Thus, when blood glucose is high, insulin secretion is stimulated and glucagon secretion is inhibited. The mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves a minor delay in gastric emptying in the early postprandial phase.	Bay-e-6975|climbazol|climbazole			
5065	emicizumab	Emicizumab-kxwh is a humanized monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a bispecific antibody structure binding factor IXa and factor X. Emicizumab-kxwh has an approximate molecular weight of 145.6 kDa and is produced in genetically engineered mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells. Emicizumab-kxwh has no structural relationship or sequence homology to FVIII and, as such, does not induce or enhance the development of direct inhibitors to FVIII. Emicizumab-kxwh bridges activated factor IX and factor X to restore the function of missing activated factor VIII that is needed for effective hemostasis.	parabolan|trenbolone cyclohexylmethylcarbonate|trenbolone hexahydrobenzylcarbonate

5069	angiotensin II	Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring peptide hormone of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone release. Direct action of angiotensin II on the vessel wall is mediated by binding to the G-protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor type 1 on vascular smooth muscle cells, which stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction.	obizur|susoctocog alfa

5070	padeliporfin	Padeliporfin is retained within the vascular system. When activated with 753 nm wavelength laser light, padeliporfin triggers a cascade of pathophysiological events resulting in focal necrosis within a few days. Activation within the illuminated tumour vasculature, generates oxygen radicals causing local hypoxia that induces the release of nitric oxide radicals. This results in transient arterial vasodilatation that triggers the release of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1. Rapid consumption of the NO radicals, by oxygen radicals, leads to the formation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (e.g. peroxynitrite), in parallel to arterial constriction. In addition, impaired deformability is thought to enhance erythrocyte aggregability and formation of blood clots at the interface of the arterial supply (feeding arteries) and tumour microcirculation, results in occlusion of the tumour vasculature. This is enhanced by RNS-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and initiation of self-propagated tumour cells necrosis through peroxidation of their membrane.	asparaginase|elspar			
5071	bictegravir	Bictegravir inhibits the strand transfer activity of HIV-1 integrase (integrase strand transfer inhibitor; INSTI), an HIV-1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication.

IBAT is the bile acid/sodium symporter responsible for the reuptake of bile acids in the ileum which is the initial step in the enterohepatic circulation. By inhibiting the uptake of bile acids, elobixibat increases the bile acid concentration in the gut, and this accelerates intestinal passage and softens the stool.	policosanol			
5075	apalutamide	Apalutamide is an Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor that binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the AR. Apalutamide inhibits AR nuclear translocation, inhibits DNA binding, and impedes AR-mediated transcription. A major metabolite, N-desmethyl apalutamide, is a less potent inhibitor of AR, and exhibited one-third the activity of apalutamide in an in vitro transcriptional reporter assay. Apalutamide administration caused decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis leading to decreased tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer.

5083	moxidectin	The mechanism by which moxidectin exhibits its effect against O. volvulus is not known. Studies with other nematodes suggest that moxidectin binds to glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCl), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and/or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This leads to increased permeability, influx of chloride ions, hyperpolarization and muscle paralysis. Additionally, there is a reduction in motility of all stages of the parasite, excretion of immunomodulatory proteins, and the fertility of both male and female adult worms.

5086	encorafenib	Encorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF V600E, as well as wild-type BRAF and CRAF. Mutations in the BRAF gene, such as BRAF V600E, can result in constitutively activated BRAF kinases that may stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib was also able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and substantially reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations. Encorafenib inhibited in vitro growth of tumor cell lines expressing BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing BRAF V600E, encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression.	besilesomab|scintimun

5202	revefenacin	Revefenacin is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical in vitro as well as in vivo models, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose-dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of revefenacin is predominantly a site-specific effect.	INCB028050|LY3009104|baricitinib|olumiant

5209	caplacizumab	In patients with aTTP, levels of a substance called von Willebrand factor are increased. von Willebrand factor acts on platelets to cause them to stick together and form blood clots. Caplacizumab, the active substance in Cablivi, is a nanobody (a small antibody) which has been designed to attach to von Willebrand factor in a way that stops it acting on platelets. This reduces platelets sticking together and forming clots in blood vessels and, as a result, platelet levels in the blood rise because they are no longer taken up to form clots.	icotinib|icotinib hydrochloride			
5211	lanadelumab	Lanadelumab-flyo is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1/kappa-light chain) that binds plasma kallikrein and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Plasma kallikrein is a protease that cleaves high-molecular-weight-kininogen (HMWK) to generate cleaved HMWK (cHMWK) and bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in swelling and pain associated with HAE.In patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction, normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity is not present, which leads to uncontrolled increases in plasma kallikrein activity and results in angioedema attacks. Lanadelumab-flyo decreases plasma kallikrein activity to control excess bradykinin generation in patients with HAE.	YN968D1|apatinib|apatinib mesilate|apatinib mesylate|rivoceranib

5341	volanesorsen	Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit the formation of apoC-III, a protein that is recognised to regulate both triglyceride metabolism and hepatic clearance of chylomicrons and other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. The selective binding of volanesorsen to the apoC-III messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) within the 3′ untranslated region at base position 489-508 causes the degradation of the mRNA. This binding prevents translation of the protein apoC-III, thus removing an inhibitor of triglyceride clearance and enabling metabolism through an LPL-independent pathway	AC010220|AC220|quizartinib|quizartinib dihydrochloride|quizartinib hydrochloride|vanflyta			
5342	andexanet alfa	Andexanet alfa is a recombinant form of human FXa protein that has been modified to lack FXa enzymatic activity. The active site serine was substituted with alanine, rendering the molecule unable to cleave and activate prothrombin, and the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain was removed to eliminate the ability of the protein to assemble into the prothrombinase complex, thus removing any anti-coagulant effects. Andexanet alfa is a specific reversal agent for FXa inhibitors. The predominant mechanism of action is the binding and sequestration of the FXa inhibitor, although there may be a minor contribution from the inhibition of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) activity through binding to TFPI. The interaction between andexanet alfa and TFPI has not been fully characterized. Andexanet alfa binds direct FXa inhibitors with high affinity, making them unavailable to exert their anticoagulant effects	recarbrio|relebactam

5436	ropeginterferon alfa-2b	Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a recombinant interferon alfa-2b conjugated with a two-arm methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). It belongs to the class of type I interferons which exhibit their cellular effects by binding to a transmembrane receptor termed interferon alfa receptor (IFNAR). Binding to IFNAR initiates a downstream signalling cascade through the activation of kinases, in particular Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Nuclear translocation of STAT proteins controls distinct gene-expression programs and exhibit various cellular effects. Interferon alfa was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of hematopoietic and bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells and antagonised the action of growth factors and other cytokines that have a role in the development of myelofibrosis. These actions may be involved in the therapeutic effects of interferon alfa in polycythaemia vera.Further, it was demonstrated that interferon alfa is able to decrease the mutated JAK2V617F allele burden in patients with polycythaemia vera (a V617F point mutation in the JAK2 kinase is a hallmark of polycythaemia vera and is  present in approximately 95% of patients)	REGN3470|atoltivimab|inmazeb			
5437	sotagliflozin	Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter type 1 (SGLT1) and SGLT2. Local intestinal inhibition of SGLT1, the major transporter for glucose absorption, delays and reduces glucose absorption in the proximal intestine, resulting in a blunting and delay of postprandial hyperglycaemia. SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. By inhibiting SGLT2, sotagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion	REGN3479|maftivimab

5439	quizartinib	Quizartinib is the most selective type II FLT3 inhibitor and has shown the strongest single-agent activity in patient population with R/R-AML (acute myeloid leukemia) with FLT3 mutations. The FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors act as direct inhibitors of FLT3 via competitive inhibition of ATP-binding sites in the FLT3 receptor. Type II FLT3 inhibitors bind the FLT3 receptor in the inactive conformation in a region adjacent to the ATP-binding domain. As a result of this binding affinity, these inhibitors prevent activity of ITD (the internal tandem duplication) mutations but do not target TKD (the tyrosine kinase domain) mutations	BAY 1021189|MK-1242|vericiguat|verquvo

5440	relebactam	RECARBRIO is a combination of imipenem/cilastatin and relebactam. Imipenem is a penem antibacterial drug, cilastatin sodium is a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor, and relebactam is a beta lactamase inhibitor. Cilastatin limits the renal metabolism of imipenem and does not have antibacterial activity. The bactericidal activity of imipenem results from binding to PBP 2 and PBP 1B in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the subsequent inhibition of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Inhibition of PBPs leads to the disruption of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Imipenem is stable in the presence of some beta lactamases. Relebactam  has  no  intrinsic  antibacterial  activity. Relebactam protects  imipenem  from  degradation  by certain serine beta lactamases such as Sulhydryl Variable (SHV), Temoneira (TEM), Cefotaximase-Munich 13 Reference ID: 4462927 (CTX-M), Enterobacter   cloacae P99   (P99), Pseudomonas-derived   cephalosporinase   (PDC),   and Klebsiella-pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)	GSK1265744|cabotegravir|cabotegravir sodium|vocabria

5447	lefamulin	XENLETA is a semi-synthetic antibacterial agent for oral and intravenous administration. Lefamulin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and Van der Waals forces) with the A- and P-sites of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in domain V of the 23s rRNA of the 50S subunit. The binding pocket of the bacterial ribosome closes around the mutilin core for an induced fit that prevents correct positioning of tRNA.	ZP4207|dasiglucagon|dasiglucagon hydrochloride|zegalogue			
5449	tenapanor	IBSRELA (tenapanor) tablets contain tenapanor hydrochloride as an active ingredient. Tenapanor hydrochloride is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitor for oral use, an antiporter expressed on the apical surface of the small intestine and colon primarily responsible for the absorption of dietary sodium. In vitro and animal studies indicate its major metabolite, M1, is not active against NHE3. By inhibiting NHE3 on the apical surface of the enterocytes, tenapanor reduces absorption of sodium from the small intestine and colon, resulting in an increase in water secretion into the intestinal lumen, which accelerates intestinal transit time and results in a softer stool consistency.

5754	evinacumab	Evinacumab-dgnb is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family that is expressed primarily in the liver and plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). Evinacumab-dgnb inhibition of ANGPTL3 leads to reduction in LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides (TG). Evinacumab-dgnb reduces LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL receptor (LDLR) by promoting very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation. Evinacumab-dgnb blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TG and HDL-C by rescuing LPL and EL activities, respectively.				
5755	estetrol	Estetrol is a synthetic analogue of a native estrogen present during pregnancy, that is selective for nuclear estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta.

The major human metabolites of infigratinib, BHS697 and CQM157, have similar in vitro binding affinities for FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 compared to infigratinib. Infigratinib inhibited FGFR signaling and decreased cell proliferation in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR amplifications, mutations, or fusions. Constitutive FGFR signaling can support the proliferation and survival of malignant cells. Infigratinib had anti-tumor activity in mouse and rat xenograft models of human tumors with activating FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, including two patient-derived xenograft models of cholangiocarcinoma that expressed FGFR2-TTC28 or FGFR2-TRA2B fusions. Infigratinib demonstrated brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (based on AUC0-inf) of 0.682 in rats after a single oral dose.				
5766	samidorphan	Samidorphan was first approved in combination with olanzapine by the FDA on May 28, 2021, under the name LYBALVI. The mechanism of action of samidorphan could be mediated through opioid receptor antagonism.				
5767	sotorasib	Sotorasib is an inhibitor of KRASG12C, a tumor-restricted, mutant-oncogenic form of the RAS GTPase, KRAS. Sotorasib forms an irreversible, covalent bond with the unique cysteine of KRASG12C, locking the protein in an inactive state that prevents downstream signaling without affecting wild-type KRAS. Sotorasib blocked KRAS signaling, inhibited cell growth, and promoted apoptosis only in KRAS G12C tumor cell lines. Sotorasib inhibited KRASG12C in vitro and in vivo with minimal detectable off-target activity. In mouse tumor xenograft models sotorasib-treatment led to tumor regressions and prolonged survival and was associated with anti-tumor immunity in KRAS G12C models.				
5768	ibrexafungerp	Ibrexafungerp, a triterpenoid antifungal agent, inhibits glucan synthase, an enzyme involved in the formation of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. Ibrexafungerp has concentration-dependent fungicidal activity against Candida species as measured by time kill studies. Ibrexafungerp retains in vitro antifungal activity when tested at pH 4.5 (the normal vaginal pH).				
5769	amivantamab	Amivantamab-vmjw is a bispecific antibody that binds to the extracellular domains of EGFR and MET. In in vitro and in vivo studies amivantamab-vmjw was able to disrupt EGFR and MET signaling functions through blocking ligand binding and, in exon 20 insertion mutation models, degradation of EGFR and MET. The presence of EGFR and MET on the surface of tumor cells also allows for targeting of these cells for destruction by immune effector cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages, through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC) and trogocytosis mechanisms, respectively.

5770	aducanumab	Aducanumab-avwa is a human, immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta. The accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain is a defining pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer’s disease. ADUHELM reduces amyloid beta plaques, as evaluated in Studies 1, 2, and 3.				
5771	finerenone	Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen, and glucocorticoid receptors.				
5772	fexinidazole	Studies with Trypanosoma brucei and other protozoans suggest that, like for other nitrocontaining drugs, the nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme plays an important role in the bioactivation of fexinidazole resulting in generation of reactive amines and damage to DNA and proteins. The activity of fexinidazole and its metabolites (M1 and M2) is trypanocidal and appears to be concentration and time dependent. However, the precise mechanism by which fexinidazole and the two metabolites exhibit activity against T. brucei is not known.				
5773	belumosudil	Belumosudil is an inhibitor of rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) which inhibits ROCK2 and ROCK1 with IC50 values of approximately 100 nanoM and 3 microM, respectively. Belumosudil downregulated proinflammatory responses via regulation of STAT3/STAT5 phosphorylation and shifting Th17/Treg balance in ex-vivo or in vitro-human T cell assays. Belumosudil also inhibited aberrant pro-fibrotic signaling, in vitro. In vivo, belumosudil demonstrated activity in animal models of chronic GVHD.				
5774	odevixibat	Odevixibat is a reversible inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). It decreases the reabsorption of bile acids (primarily the salt forms) from the terminal ileum. Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with PFIC and the pathophysiology of pruritus in patients with PFIC is not completely understood. Although the complete mechanism by which odevixibat improves pruritus in PFIC patients is unknown, it may involve inhibition of the IBAT, which results in decreased reuptake of bile salts, as observed by a decrease in serum bile acids.				
5775	belzutifan	Belzutifan is an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF-2alpha), with potential antineoplastic activity. HIF-2alpha is a transcription factor that plays a role in oxygen sensing by regulating genes that promote adaptation to hypoxia. Under normal oxygen levels, HIF-2alpha is targeted for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation by VHL protein. Lack of functional VHL protein results in stabilization and accumulation of HIF-2alpha. Upon stabilization, HIF-2alpha translocates into the nucleus and interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 beta (HIF-1beta) to form a transcriptional complex that induces expression of downstream genes, including genes associated with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Belzutifan binds to HIF-2alpha, and in conditions of hypoxia or impairment of VHL protein function, belzutifan blocks the HIF-2alpha-HIF-1beta interaction, leading to reduced transcription and expression of HIF-2alpha target genes. In vivo, belzutifan demonstrated anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of renal cell carcinoma.				
5776	difelikefalin	Difelikefalin is a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. The relevance of KOR activation to therapeutic effectiveness is not known.				
5777	mobocertinib	Mobocertinib is a kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that irreversibly binds to and inhibits EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations at lower concentrations than wild type (WT) EGFR. Two pharmacologically-active metabolites (AP32960 and AP32914) with similar inhibitory profiles to mobocertinib have been identified in the plasma after oral administration of mobocertinib. In vitro, mobocertinib also inhibited the activity of other EGFR family members (HER2 and HER4) and one additional kinase (BLK) at clinically relevant concentrations (IC50 values <2 nM).				
5778	atogepant	Atogepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.				
578	kainic acid	(2S-(2 alpha,3 beta,4 beta))-2-Carboxy-4-(1-methylethenyl)-3-pyrrolidineacetic acid. Ascaricide obtained from the red alga Digenea simplex. It is a potent excitatory amino acid agonist at some types of excitatory amino acid receptors and has been used to discriminate among receptor types. Like many excitatory amino acid agonists it can cause neurotoxicity and has been used experimentally for that purpose.	(+)-Cerulenin|cerulenin|helicocerin			
5780	maralixibat hydrochloride	Maralixibat is a reversible inhibitor of the ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT). It decreases the reabsorption of bile acids (primarily the salt forms) from the terminal ileum. Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with ALGS and the pathophysiology of pruritus in patients with ALGS is not completely understood. Although the complete mechanism by which maralixibat improves pruritus in ALGS patients is unknown, it may involve inhibition of the IBAT, which results in decreased reuptake of bile salts, as observed by a decrease in serum bile acids.				
5781	anifrolumab	Anifrolumab-fnia is a human IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) with high specificity and affinity. This binding inhibits type I IFN signaling, thereby blocking the biologic activity of type I IFNs. Anifrolumab-fnia also induces the internalization of IFNAR1, thereby reducing the levels of cell surface IFNAR1 available for receptor assembly. Blockade of receptor mediated type I IFN signaling inhibits IFN responsive gene expression as well as downstream inflammatory and immunological processes. Inhibition of type I IFN blocks plasma cell differentiation and normalizes peripheral T-cell subsets. Type I IFNs play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE. Approximately 60-80% of adult patients with active SLE express elevated levels of type I IFN inducible genes.				
5782	avalglucosidase alfa	Avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt provides an exogenous source of GAA. The M6P on avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt mediates binding to M6P receptors on the cell surface with high affinity. After binding, it is internalized and transported into lysosomes where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased GAA enzymatic activity. Avalglucosidase alfa-ngpt then exerts enzymatic activity in cleaving glycogen.				
5783	lonapegsomatropin	Lonapegsomatropin is a pegylated human growth hormone (somatropin) for once-weekly subcutaneous injection. Somatropin binds to the growth hormone (GH) receptor in the cell membrane of target cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Somatropin has direct tissue and metabolic effects, and indirect effects mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), including stimulation of chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation, stimulation of hepatic glucose output, protein synthesis and lipolysis. Somatropin stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as a result of effects on the growth plates (epiphyses) of long bones.				
5784	tisotumab vedotin	Tisotumab vedotin-tftv is a tissue factor (TF)-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody is a human IgG1 directed against cell surface TF. TF is the primary initiator of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The small molecule, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent, attached to the antibody via a protease-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggests that the anticancer activity of tisotumab vedotin-tftv is due to the binding of the ADC to TF expressing cancer cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-TF complex, and release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In vitro, tisotumab vedotin-tftv also mediates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.				
5785	bimekizumab	Bimekizumab is a humanised IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex. Elevated concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17F have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases including plaque psoriasis. Bimekizumab inhibits these proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in the normalization of skin inflammation and as a consequence improvement in clinical symptoms associated with psoriasis. From in vitro models, bimekizumab was shown to inhibit psoriasis-related gene expression and cytokine production to a greater extent than inhibition of IL-17A alone.				
5787	tralokinumab	Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the type 2 cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-13 receptors. Tralokinumab neutralises the biological activity of IL-13 by blocking its interaction with the IL-13Ralpha1/IL-4Ralpha receptor complex. IL-13 is a major driver of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis and inhibiting the IL-13 pathway with tralokinumab in patients decreases many of the mediators of type 2 inflammation.				
5788	vosoritide	Vosoritide is a modified type C natriuretic peptide (CNP). In patients with achondroplasia, endochondral bone growth is negatively regulated due to a gain of function mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Binding of vosoritide to natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B) antagonises FGFR3 downstream signalling by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway at the level of rapidly accelerating fibrosarcoma serine/threonine protein kinase (RAF-1). As a result, vosoritide, like CNP, acts as a positive regulator of endochondral bone growth as it promotes chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.				
5789	peficitinib	Peficitinib inhibits the signal transduction of cytokines important for the pathological condition of RA as it inhibits the kinase activity of the JAK family (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and their signal transduction mediated by IL-2.

5791	upacicalcet	Upacicalcet acts directly on parathyroid cell membrane calcium-sensing receptors and it suppresses excessive parathyroid hormone secretion.				
5792	imeglimin	Imeglimin is a first-in-class oral agent which improves pancreatic beta-cell function and enhances insulin action in key tissues, including liver and skeletal muscle.				
5794	teceleukin	a recombinant IL-2 product having a methionine added at the N-terminal.				
5795	potassium sulfate	Potassium sulfate is used to cleanse the colon (bowel) before colonoscopy in combination with sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate.				
5796	molidustat	Molidustat (BAY 85–3934) is a novel, orally bioavailable HIF-PH inhibitor that mimics hypoxia by stabilizing HIF-a subunits. Molidustat inhibits HIF-PH, allowing the accumulation of HIF, which then translocates to the nucleus where it activates the transcription of erythropoietin (EPO) and other hypoxia-inducible genes, thereby increasing endogenous EPO levels and formation of the red blood cell.				
5797	anamorelin	Anamorelin is a potent and selective novel ghrelin receptor agonist that mimics the N-terminal active core of ghrelin. ANAM stimulates neuroendocrine responses and can induce rapid positive effects on appetite and metabolism, which can lead to an increase in body weight and lean body mass.				
5798	pabinafusp alfa	Pabinafusp alfa is a fusion protein consisting of a humanized anti-hTfR antibody and hIDS. The humanized anti-hTfR antibody is considered to bind to TfRs expressed in the luminal cell membrane of brain microvascular endothelial cells composing the blood-brain barrier, being transported together with the TfR, passing through brain microvascular endothelial cells via transcytosis (which involves the mechanisms of uptake into the cell via endocytosis and release outside the cell via exocytosis) and further penetrating the basal lamina into neuronal cells in the brain parenchyma. In addition, after binding of pabinafusp alfa to M6PR on the cell membrane and cellular uptake via endocytosis, newly formed endosomes are thought to fuse with lysosomes and move into them. In patients with MPS, the type of accumulating GAG differs depending on the MPS phenotype, and CNS symptoms develops in patients with MPS phenotypes that are associated with the accumulation of HS. HS concentrations in CSF are high in patients with MPS-II who have intellectual disability, compared with those who do not have intellectual disability. These findings and other factors have suggested that HS plays a vital role in the development of CNS symptoms. The hIDS of pabinafusp alfa is considered to promote the degradation of HS in the brain parenchyma, thereby suppressing the development or progression of CNS symptoms. It has been demonstrated that pabinafusp alfa has binding affinity for M6PR and hTfR, and is taken up by human fibroblasts via the receptors.				
5799	diclofenac etalhyaluronate sodium	Diclofenac etalhyaluronate is a 130,000 kDa compound in which the diclofenac molecule is attached via a 2-aminoethanol linker to the glucuronic acid moiety of the hyaluronic acid. Diclofenac is released through hydrolytic cleavage of the ester linkage and it inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandin E2.

5800	esaxerenone	Esaxerenone is an oral, selective  nonsteroidal  mineralocorticoid  receptor antagonist used for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathies.				
5801	mirogabalin	Mirogabalin, a novel ligand for the alpha2delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, has been approved for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain including painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPNP) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in Japan. Mirogabalin showed potent and selective binding affinities for the alpha2delta subunits, and slower dissociation rates for the alpha2delta-1 subunit than for the alpha2delta-2 subunit. It also showed potent and long-lasting analgesic effects in rat models of neuropathic pain, and wider safety margins for the central nervous system side effects. A pharmacological study using mutant mice demonstrated that the analgesic effects of mirogabalin were mediated by binding of the drug to the alpha2delta-1 subunit, not the alpha2delta-2 subunit.				
5802	idursulfase beta	Enzyme replacement therapy product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome				
5803	daridorexant	The mechanism of action of daridorexant in the treatment of insomnia is presumed to be through antagonism of orexin receptors. The orexin neuropeptide signaling system plays a role in wakefulness. Blocking the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to receptors OX1R and OX2R is thought to suppress wake drive.				
5804	avacopan	Avacopan is a complement 5a receptor (C5aR) antagonist that inhibits the interaction between C5aR and the anaphylatoxin C5a. Avacopan blocks C5a-mediated neutrophil activation and migration. The precise mechanism by which avacopan exerts a therapeutic effect in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis has not been definitively established.				
5805	asciminib	Asciminib is an ABL/BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Asciminib inhibits the ABL1 kinase activity of the BCR­ABL1 fusion protein, by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket. In studies conducted in vitro or in animal models of CML, asciminib showed activity against wild-type BCR-ABL1 and several mutant forms of the kinase, including the T315I mutation.				
5806	maribavir	Livtencity is an antiviral drug against human cytomegalovirus. The antiviral activity of maribavir is mediated by competitive inhibition of the protein kinase activity of human CMV enzyme pUL97, which results in inhibition of the phosphorylation of proteins. Maribavir inhibited wildtype pUL97 protein kinase in a biochemical assay with an IC50 value of 0.003 microM.				
5807	pafolacianine	Cytalux is a fluorescent drug that targets folate receptor (FR) which may be overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Pafolacianine binds to FR-expressing cancer cells with affinity of approximately 1 nM, internalizes via receptor mediated endocytosis, and concentrates in FR-positive cancer tissues.

590	phenyl salicylate					
5906	inclisiran	Inclisiran is a double-stranded small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), conjugated on the sense strand with triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to facilitate uptake by hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, inclisiran utilizes the RNA interference mechanism and directs catalytic breakdown of mRNA for PCSK9. This increases LDL-C receptor recycling and expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which increases LDL-C uptake and lowers LDL-C levels in the circulation.				
5907	efgartigimod alfa	Efgartigimod alfa-fcab is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG.				
5908	tezepelumab	Tezepelumab-ekko is a thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) blocker, human monoclonal antibody IgG2lambda that binds to human TSLP with a dissociation constant of 15.8 pM and blocks its interaction with the heterodimeric TSLP receptor. TSLP is a cytokine mainly derived from epithelial cells and occupies an upstream position in the asthma inflammatory cascade. Airway inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, ILC2 cells) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) are involved in airway inflammation. Blocking TSLP with tezepelumab-ekko reduces biomarkers and cytokines associated with inflammation including blood eosinophils, airway submucosal eosinophils, IgE, FeNO, IL-5, and IL-13; however, the mechanism of tezepelumab-ekko action in asthma has not been definitively established.				
5909	regdanvimab	Regdanvimab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike(s) protein of SARS-CoV-2 consequently blocking cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

5910	diroximel fumarate	The mechanism by which diroximel fumarate exerts therapeutic effects in MS is not fully understood. Diroximel fumarate acts via the major active metabolite, monomethyl fumarate. Preclinical studies indicate that the pharmacodynamic responses of monomethyl fumarate appears to be mediated, at least in part, through activation of the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) transcriptional pathway. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to up regulate Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes in patients.				
5911	difamilast	Difamilast is a novel atopic dermatitis drug that has phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitory activity. PDE4 inhibitors are believed to improve the symptoms of atopic dermatitis through suppression of the production of chemical mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and through other anti-inflammatory effects.				
5912	abrocitinib	Abrocitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK)1 inhibitor. JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Inhibition of JAK1 modulates the signalling pathways by preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. It is used for  treating adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema, when the skin is itchy, red and dry).				
5913	sotrovimab	Sotrovimab is a human IgG1 mAb that binds to a highly conserved epitope on the spike protein receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.				
5914	mitapivat	Mitapivat is a pyruvate kinase activator that acts by allosterically binding to the pyruvate kinase tetramer and increasing pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. The red blood cell (RBC) form of pyruvate kinase (PK-R) is mutated in PK deficiency, which leads to reduced adenosine triphosphate(ATP), shortened RBC lifespan, and chronic hemolysis.				
5915	pacritinib	Pacritinib is a kinase inhibitor with activity against Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2) and Fms-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Pacritinib inhibits both wild-type JAK2 and the JAK2V617F mutant form that is common in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Pacritinib also exhibits inhibitory activity against additional cellular kinases (such as colony-stimulating factor 1 and interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1), the clinical relevance of which is unknown.				
5916	ganaxolone	The precise mechanism by which ganaxolone exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of seizures associated with CDD is unknown, but its anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from positive allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor in the CNS.				
5917	lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan	Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan is a radioligand therapeutic agent. The active moiety of lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan is the radionuclide lutetium-177 which is linked to a moiety that binds to PSMA, a transmembrane protein that is expressed in prostate cancer, including mCRPC. Upon binding of lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan to PSMA- expressing cells, the beta-minus emission from lutetium-177 delivers radiation to PSMA-expressing cells, as well as to surrounding cells, and induces DNA damage which can lead to cell death.				
5918	oteseconazole	Oteseconazole is an azole metalloenzyme inhibitor targeting the fungal sterol, 14alpha demethylase(CYP51), an enzyme that catalyzes an early step in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, a sterol required for fungal cell membrane formation and integrity. Inhibition of CYP51 results in the accumulation of 14-methylated sterols, some of which are toxic to fungi. Through the inclusion of a tetrazole metal-binding group, oteseconazole has a lower affinity for human CYP enzymes.				
5919	mavacamten	Mavacamten is an allosteric and reversible inhibitor selective for cardiac myosin. Mavacamten modulates the number of myosin heads that can enter “on actin” (power-generating) states, thus reducing the probability of force-producing (systolic) and residual (diastolic) cross-bridge formation. Excess myosin actin cross-bridge formation and dysregulation of the super-relaxed state are mechanistic hallmarks of HCM. Mavacamten shifts the overall myosin population towards an energy-sparing, recruitable, super-relaxed state. In HCM patients, myosin inhibition with mavacamten reduces dynamic LVOT obstruction and improves cardiac filling pressures.				
592	sulfacetamide	An anti-bacterial agent that is used topically to treat skin infections and orally for urinary tract infections.	chlorbetamide|clorbetamida|mantomide			
5920	sutimlimab	Sutimlimab-jome is an immunoglobulin G (IgG), subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the classical complement pathway (CP) and specifically binds to complement protein component 1, s subcomponent (C1s), a serine protease which cleaves C4. Sutimlimab­-jome does not inhibit the lectin and alternative pathways. Inhibition of the classical complement pathway at the level of C1s prevents deposition of complement opsonins on the surface of RBCs, resulting in inhibition of hemolysis in patients with CAD.				
5921	tebentafusp	Tebentafusp-tebn is a bispecific gp100 peptide-HLA-A02:01 directed T cell receptor CD3 T cell engager. The TCR arm binds to a gp100 peptide presented by human leukocyte antigen-A*02:01 (HLA¬ A02:01) on the cell surface of uveal melanoma tumor cells. In vitro, tebentafusp-tebn bound to HLA-A02:01-positive uveal melanoma cells and activated polyclonal T cells to release inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, which results in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumor cells.				
5922	relatlimab	Relatlimab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the LAG-3 receptor, blocks interaction with its ligands, including MHC II, and reduces LAG-3 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response. Antagonism of this pathway promotes T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors, and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor, blocks interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, and reduces PD-1 pathwaymediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. The combination of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and relatlimab (anti-LAG-3) results in increased T-cell activation compared to the activity of either antibody alone. In murine syngeneic tumor models, LAG-3 blockade potentiates the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blockage, inhibiting tumor growth and promoting tumor regression.				
5923	faricimab	Faricimab is a humanized bispecific antibody that acts through inhibition of two pathways by binding to VEGF-A and Ang-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A, faricimab suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, neovascularization and vascular permeability. By inhibiting Ang-2, faricimab is thought to promote vascular stability and desensitize blood vessels to the effects of VEGF-A. Ang-2 levels are increased in some patients with nAMD and DME. The contribution of Ang-2 inhibition to the treatment effect and clinical response for nAMD and DME has yet to be established.				
5924	tirzepatide	Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is a 39-amino-acid modified peptide with a C20 fatty diacid moiety that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. Tirzepatide selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1. Tirzepatide enhances first- and second-phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels, both in a glucosedependent manner.				
5925	somatrogon	Somatrogon is a glycoprotein comprised of the amino acid sequence of hGH with one copy of the of C-terminal peptide (CTP) from the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the N-terminus and two copies of CTP (in tandem) at the C-terminus. The glycosylation and CTP domains account for the half-life of somatrogon, which allows for weekly dosing. Somatrogon binds to the GH receptor and initiates a signal transduction cascade culminating in changes in growth and metabolism. Consistent with GH signalling, somatrogon binding leads to activation of the STAT5b signalling pathway and increases the serum concentration of IGF-1. IGF-1 was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner during treatment with somatrogon partially mediating the clinical effect. As a result, GH and IGF-1 stimulate metabolic changes, linear growth and enhance growth velocity in paediatric patients with GHD.				
5926	clazosentan	Clazosentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of cerebrovascular spasm after surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by cerebral aneurysm, and cerebral infarctions and cerebral ischemic symptoms accompanying the cerebrovascular spasm.				
5927	gefapixant	Gefapixant is a selective, non-narcotic P2X3 receptor antagonist being approved for the treatment of refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough.				
5928	nirmatrelvir	Nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) is an antiviral therapeutic developed by Pfizer for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It received conditional approval  by EMA, FDA and PMDA. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332) is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), also referred to as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) or nsp5 protease. Inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro renders the protein incapable of processing polyprotein precursors which leads to the prevention of viral replication. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of PF-07321332, thereby providing increased plasma concentrations of PF-07321332.

Tremelimumab-actl is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction with its ligands CD80 and CD86, releasing CTLA-4-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation. In synergistic mouse tumor models, blocking CTLA-4 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth and increased proliferation of T cells in tumors.				
6184	mirvetuximab soravtansine	Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The antibody is a chimeric IgG1 directed against folate receptor alpha (FRalpha). The small molecule, DM4, is a microtubule inhibitor attached to the antibody via a cleavable linker. Upon binding to FRalpha, mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx is internalized followed by intracellular release of DM4 via proteolytic cleavage. DM4 disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death.				
6185	teplizumab	Teplizumab-mzwv binds to CD3 (a cell surface antigen present on T lymphocytes) and delays the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes in adults and pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 type 1 diabetes. The mechanism may involve partial agonistic signaling and deactivation of pancreatic beta cell autoreactive T lymphocytes. Teplizumab-mzwv leads to an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells and of exhausted CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood.				
6187	olutasidenib	Olutasidenib is a small-molecule inhibitor of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1). In patients with AML, susceptible IDH1 mutations are defined as those leading to increased levels of 2- hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in the leukemia cells and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful remissions with the recommended dose of olutasidenib and/or 2) inhibition of mutant IDH1 enzymatic activity at concentrations of olutasidenib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods. The most common of such mutations in patients with AML are R132H and R132C substitutions. In vitro, olutasidenib inhibited mutated IDH1 R132H, R132L, R132S, R132G, and R132C proteins; wild-type IDH1 or mutated IDH2 proteins were not inhibited. Olutasidenib inhibition of mutant IDH1 led to decreased 2-HG levels in vitro and in in vivo xenograft models.				
6189	adagrasib	Adagrasib is an irreversible inhibitor of KRAS G12C that covalently binds to the mutant cysteine in KRAS G12C and locks the mutant KRAS protein in its inactive state that prevents downstream signaling without affecting wild-type KRAS protein. Adagrasib inhibits tumor cell growth and viability in cells harboring KRAS G12C mutations and results in tumor regression in KRAS G12C-mutated tumor xenograft models with minimal off-target activity.

6203	bexagliflozin	Bexagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the transporter responsible for reabsorption of the majority of glucose from the renal glomerular filtrate in the renal proximal tubule. By inhibiting SGLT2, bexagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion.				
6204	pirtobrutinib	Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK is a signaling protein of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Pirtobrutinib binds to wild type BTK and BTK harboring C481 mutations, leading to inhibition of BTK kinase activity. In nonclinical studies, pirtobrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated B-cell CD69 expression and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation. Pirtobrutinib showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activities in BTK wild type and BTK C481S mutant mouse xenograft models.				
6205	elacestrant	Elacestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that binds to estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalfa). In ER-positive (ER+) HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer cells, elacestrant inhibited 17beta-estradiol mediated cell proliferation at concentrations inducing degradation of ERalfa protein mediated through proteasomal pathway. Elacestrant demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity including in ER+ HER2- breast cancer models resistant to fulvestrant and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors and those harboring estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1) mutations.				
6206	sparsentan	Sparsentan is a single molecule with antagonism of the endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Sparsentan has high affinity for both the ETAR (Ki= 12.8 nM) and the AT1R (Ki=0.36 nM), and greater than 500-fold selectivity for these receptors over the endothelin type B and angiotensin II subtype 2 receptors. Endothelin-1 and angiotensin II are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of IgAN via the ETAR and AT1R, respectively				
6207	omaveloxolone	The precise mechanism by which omaveloxolone exerts its therapeutic effect in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia is unknown. Omaveloxolone have been shown to activate the Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway in vitro and in vivo in animals and humans. The Nrf2 pathway is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress.

6210	leniolisib	Leniolisib inhibits PI3K-delta by blocking the active binding site of PI3K-delta. In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, leniolisib was selective for PI3K-delta over PI3K-alpha (28-fold), PI3K-beta (43-fold), and PI3K-gamma (257-fold), as well as the broader kinome. In cell-based assays, leniolisib reduced pAKT pathway activity and inhibited proliferation and activation of B and T cell subsets. Gain-of-function variants in the gene encoding the p110-delta catalytic subunit or loss of function variants in the gene encoding the p85-alpha regulatory subunit each cause hyperactivity of PI3K-delta. Leniolisib inhibits the signalling pathways that lead to increased production of PIP3, hyperactivity of the downstream mTOR/AKT pathway, and to the dysregulation of B and T cells.				
6211	rezafungin	Rezafungin is a semi-synthetic echinocandin. Rezafungin inhibits the 1,3-beta-D glucan synthase enzyme complex, which is present in fungal cell walls but not in mammalian cells. This results in inhibition of the formation of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall of many fungi, including Candida species (spp.). Inhibition of 1,3-beta-D-glucan synthesis results in concentration-dependent in vitro fungicidal activity against Candida spp., however, the clinical significance of this activity is unknown.				
6212	lecanemab	Lecanemab-irmb is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta. The accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain is a defining pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer disease.				
6213	velmanase	Velmanase alfa-tycv provides an exogenous source of alpha-mannosidase. Velmanase alfa-tycv is internalized via binding to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor on the cell surface and transported into lysosomes where it is thought to exert enzyme activity. Alpha-mannosidosis is a lysosomal storage disease that results from reduced activity of the enzyme alpha-mannosidase, caused by gene variants in Mannosidase Alpha Class 2B Member 1. Alpha-mannosidase catalyzes the degradation of accumulated mannose-containing oligosaccharides. The deficiency of alpha-mannosidase causes an intra-lysosomal accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in various tissues.				
6214	retifanlimab	Retifanlimab-dlwr binds to the PD-1 receptor, blocks interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, and potentiates T-cell activity. Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors, and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors.				
6215	pegunigalsidase alfa	Pegunigalsidase alfa is a pegylated recombinant form of human alpha-galactosidase-A. The amino acid sequence of the recombinant form is similar to the naturally occurring human enzyme. Pegunigalsidase alfa supplements or replaces alpha-galactosidase-A, the enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of the terminal α-galactosyl moieties of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in the lysosome, reducing the amount of accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3).				
6216	cipaglucosidase alfa	Pombiliti (cipaglucosidase alfa) is a long-term enzyme replacement therapy used in combination with the enzyme stabiliser miglustat for the treatment of adults with late-onset Pompe disease (acid alpha-glucosidase [GAA] deficiency). Cipaglucosidase alfa is intended to replace the absent or impaired endogenous enzyme. Cipaglucosidase alfa is stabilised by miglustat minimising the loss of enzyme activity in the blood during infusion of this hydrolytic glycogen-specific enzyme enriched with bis-M6P N-glycans for high affinity cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) binding. After binding, it is internalised in the lysosome where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage and N-glycan trimming which are both required to yield the most mature and active form of the GAA enzyme. Cipaglucosidase alfa then exerts enzymatic activity in cleaving glycogen and reducing intramuscular glycogen, and ameliorating tissue damage.				
6217	mirikizumab	Mirikizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal, anti-interleukin-23 (anti-IL-23) antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL-23 receptor. IL-23, a regulatory cytokine, affects the differentiation, expansion, and survival of T cell subsets, (e.g., Th17 cells and Tc17 cells) and innate immune cell subsets, which represent sources of effector cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 that drive inflammatory disease. In humans, selective blockade of IL-23 was shown to normalise production of these cytokines.				
6218	ozoralizumab	Ozoralizumab is a new type of antibody that can block the activity of TNFalpha, a protein that causes inflammation in the body. It is made of three small molecules called NANOBODIES; two of these NANOBODIES attach to TNFalpha and prevent it from binding to its receptors. The third NANOBODY binds to a protein in the blood called HSA, which helps ozoralizumab stay longer in the body. Ozoralizumab is smaller and more stable than conventional antibodies, and it may have fewer side effects. It is being developed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.				
6219	valemetostat	Valemetostat is a drug that blocks two enzymes called EZH1 and EZH2. These enzymes are involved in the growth of some blood cancers and solid tumors, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Valemetostat is used to treat a type of NHL called adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) that has come back or does not respond to other treatments.				
622	meprobamate	A carbamate with hypnotic, sedative, and some muscle relaxant properties, although in therapeutic doses reduction of anxiety rather than a direct effect may be responsible for muscle relaxation. Meprobamate has been reported to have anticonvulsant actions against petit mal seizures, but not against grand mal seizures (which may be exacerbated). It is used in the treatment of ANXIETY DISORDERS, and also for the short-term management of INSOMNIA but has largely been superseded by the BENZODIAZEPINES.

6223	ritlecitinib	Ritlecitinib irreversibly inhibits Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. In cellular settings, ritlecitinib inhibits cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK3-dependent receptors. Additionally, ritlecitinib inhibits signaling of immune receptors dependent on TEC kinase family members. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK or TEC family enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.				
6224	fezolinetant	Fezolinetant is a neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist that blocks neurokinin B (NKB) binding on the kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neuron to modulate neuronal activity in the thermoregulatory center. Fezolinetant has high affinity for the NK3 receptor (Ki value of 19.9 to 22.1 nmol/L), which is more than 450-fold higher than binding affinity to NK1 or NK2 receptors.				
6225	perfluorohexyloctane	Perfluorohexyloctane, a semifluorinated alkane, contains 6 perfluorinated carbon atoms and 8 hydrogenated carbon atoms. Perfluorohexyloctane forms a monolayer at the air-liquid interface of the tear film which can be expected to reduce evaporation. The exact mechanism of action for MIEBO in DED is not known.				
6226	durlobactam	Durlobactam is a diazabicyclooctane non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor, that protects sulbactam from degradation by certain serine-beta-lactamases. Durlobactam alone does not have antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC) isolates but in combination with sulbactam it has been approved for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), caused by susceptible isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex.				
6227	flotufolastat f-18 gallium	Flotufolastat F 18 binds to PSMA (IC50 = 4.4 nM) expressed on cells, including prostate cancer cells, and is internalized.

6232	rozanolixizumab	Rozanolixizumab-noli is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG.				
6233	glofitamab	Glofitamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds bivalently to CD20 expressed on the surface of B cells and monovalently to CD3 in the T-cell receptor complex expressed on the surface of T cells. By simultaneous binding to CD20 on the B cell and CD3 on the T cell, glofitamab mediates the formation of an immunological synapse with subsequent T-cell activation and proliferation, secretion of cytokines and release of cytolytic proteins that results in the lysis of CD20-expressing B cells.				
6234	palovarotene	n patients with FOP, abnormal bone formation, including heterotrophic ossification (HO), is driven by a gain-of-function mutation in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor ALK2 (ACVR1).Palovarotene is an orally bioavailable retinoic acid receptor agonist, with particular selectivity at the gamma subtype of RAR. Through binding to RARgamma, palovarotene decreases the BMP/ALK2 downstream signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8, which reduces ALK2/SMAD-dependent chondrogenesis and osteocyte differentiation resulting in reduced endochondral bone formation.				
6235	zuranolone	The mechanism of action of zuranolone in the treatment of PPD is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors.				
6237	avacincaptad pegol	Avacincaptad pegol is an RNA aptamer, a PEGylated oligonucleotide that binds to and inhibits complement protein C5. By inhibiting C5, avacincaptad pegol may prevent its cleavage to C5a and C5b thus decreasing membrane attack complex (MAC) formation.				
6238	pozelimab	Pozelimab-bbfg is a human, monoclonal immunoglobulin G4P (IgG4P) antibody directed against the terminal complement protein C5 that inhibits terminal complement activation by blocking cleavage of C5 into C5a (anaphylatoxin) and C5b, thereby blocking the formation of the membrane-attack complex (C5b-C9, a structure mediating cell lysis).				
6239	elranatamab	Elranatamab-bcmm is a bispecific B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed T-cell engaging antibody that binds BCMA on plasma cells, plasmablasts, and multiple myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells leading to cytolysis of the BCMA-expressing cells.

681	acyclovir	Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV and VZV. This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue. The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes. In vitro, acyclovir triphosphate stops replication of herpes viral DNA.	chloroiodoquin|chloroiodoquine|clioquinol|cliquinol|iodochlorhydroxyquin

766	riluzole	The etiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. One hypothesis is that motor neurons, made vulnerable through either genetic predisposition or environmental factors, are injured by glutamate. In some cases of familial ALS the enzyme superoxide dismutase has been found to be defective. The mode of action of riluzole is unknown. Its pharmacological properties include the following, some of which may be related to its effect: 1) an inhibitory effect on glutamate release, 2) inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels, and 3) ability to interfere with intracellular events that follow transmitter binding at excitatory amino acid receptors. Riluzole has also been shown, in a single study, to delay median time to death in a transgenic mouse model of ALS. These mice express human superoxide dismutase bearing one of the mutations found in one of the familial forms of human ALS. It is also neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models of neuronal injury involving excitotoxic mechanisms. In in vitro tests, riluzole protected cultured rat motor neurons from the excitotoxic effects of glutamic acid and prevented the death of cortical neurons induced by anoxia. Due to its blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission, riluzole also exhibits myorelaxant, sedative, and anticonvulsant properties.	cyproterone acetate|cyproviron

772	stiripentol	In animal models, stiripentol antagonizes seizures induced by electric shock, pentetrazole and bicuculline. In rodent models, stiripentol appears to increase brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. This could occur by inhibition of synaptosomal uptake of GABA and/or inhibition of GABA transaminase. Stiripentol has also been shown to enhance GABAA receptor-mediated transmission in the immature rat hippocampus and increase the mean open-duration (but not the frequency) of GABAA receptor chloride channels by a barbiturate-like mechanism. Stiripentol potentiates the efficacy of other anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines, as the result of pharmacokinetic interactions. The second effect of stiripentol is mainly based on metabolic inhibition of several isoenzymes, in particular CYP450 3A4 and 2C19, involved in the hepatic metabolism of other anti-epileptic medicines.	cyverine

973	penciclovir	The antiviral compound penciclovir has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). In cells infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted by cellular kinases to the active form penciclovir triphosphate. Biochemical studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Consequently, herpes viral DNA synthesis and, therefore, replication are selectively inhibited.	GG-745|GG745|avodart|avolve|dutasteride|veltride

981	tolpropamine		TA-2711|ecabet|ecabet sodium			
982	tizanidine	Tizanidine is an agonist at alpha2-adrenergic receptor sites and presumably reduces spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. In animal models, tizanidine has no direct effect on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and no major effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes. The effects of tizanidine are greatest on polysynaptic pathways. The overall effect of these actions is thought to reduce facilitation of spinal motor neurons.	echothiophate|echothiophate iodide|ecothiopate|ecothiophate|phospholine
